            </div>What is a Program and How does it run on CPU? Program is a mix of code and data that makes the CPU do what we want, aka super powers.
Sadly CPU only speaks Zeros and Ones that what all people say 🤷‍♂️, but the real language that we can talk to CPU still being able to keep our sanity is Instruction Set.
Ahh, sorry for the deviation.
So yeah zeros and ones.]]></description>

<p>As being a nerd about open source and CPU architecture, I&rsquo;ve decided
to learn more about <code>riscv ISA</code> (Instruction Set Architecture) and
try out making a <code>core</code> with it. In past I made my own 8bit ISA and
implemented it on FPGA, but it feel now is time to try out bigger
32bits turf and try adding some <code>AI Accelerators</code> as the finishing touch.
I have basic knowledge of how CPU works and how to write Verilog, But
I feel like I don&rsquo;t have enough experience in it. I just made a non
pipelined CPU before, so this time plan of attack will be different.</p>]]></description>

            </div>My Intro Hi, I am Mohd Fahad. I am currently studying final year of BE in ECE.
I am quite interested in working of a computer form sand to software and a big anime fan, you can name an ainme probably i&rsquo;ve watched it or know about it 😎 .
Here I will blog about my daily adventures, new things i learned and things that makes least sense to do 😇 .]]></description>
